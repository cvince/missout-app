I have had a long time to reflect on the things that happened, and have come to one conclusion. I messed up big time, in so many ways. \n\nFrom letting you walk out that door the last time, I never should have let you. I had laid my heart out on the table, and your rejections I took to mean you just didnt want me, so I let you leave. Had I known there was even the smallest part of you that still wanted me, I believe I would have stopped you, it would have been enough for me. But then again I don't believe I deserved to have you back then. You were the best thing in my otherwise dark life, you had been the only one to ever stand beside me and try to make me a better person. I look back now and can see that clearly, but I was so blinded by my own demons and rage. Yet there you were through it all, you were with me through the bad times, more then anyone else ever has even through my good times. \n\nI should have listened to my heart that day in the park, when you asked me what I wanted. My heart wanted to tell you so badly, but the rest of me just stood there like an idiot. I should have appreciated you, and the way you tried to get me away from those things that were pulling me back. I regret that my downfall dragged you into it, the one thing I can be proud of is standing up and protecting you from despite what it meant for myself. Hearing you scream at me still haunts me to this day, and has haunted me my entire life. See it was that, that made it so easy for me to believe you were done with me for good. I couldnt even begin to fathom that you still had any feelings for me. I know now that is because you saw in us what I only suspected. My life has proven to me that what we had WAS special and always will be.\n\nStill to this day, \"I don't want the world to see me, because I don't think that they'd understand. When everything's made to be broken, I just want you to know who I am\" It haunts me more then I like to admit. I tried moving on, and believed I had, but it has been shown to me, you were still there in my heart, always and forever. No matter how hard I may try, nothing else ever fit the way you did. I don't know where you are in life, though I hope you found the happiness I failed to give you. There is a great deal that I need to apologize for and to say to you. I can only hope that I will be given the chance to tell you in person some day. But no matter what, I want you to know that someone did care about you, even if he was to much of a mess to show it to you or to deserve to have you.

I've never done this before. It feels kind of silly. I was walking at the park with my son this evening, and couldn't help but notice you and your nice looking black and white dog. I was the one wearing unusual leg warmers. We happened to be walking in the same direction for a bit -- and also happened to be parked next to each other, coincidentally. As our car was pulling away, I waved -- you waved back. From the back seat my son said, \"Did you see that man? He looked sad but when you waved, he  looked happy. I bet you made his day.\" I wanted to see if maybe that were true, and if it is, then maybe you'd like to get a cup of coffee sometime. \n\t","title":"Gentleman walking his dog at Boulevard Park this evening - w4m","tempname":"anchor cabbage flyer","loc":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.5745808186254,48.76968603938073]}},{"body":"\n\t\tI couldn't help but feel this post was about me but we are both in committed relationships.

Since you seem to know her quite a bit, you must be Shay herself. Only a girl like that or a complete imbecile would use the phrase \"titanic douche\" as they have no concept of cutting someone down than to use 1st Grade terminology. Grow up and read a book and then come swinging with your lameness.\n\nAnd if she doesn't drink then maybe she should. Might loosen her up a bit. Or even smoke a bowl. No need to be a tightwad. Relax and go with the flow.\n\nTo the OP, there are many more gorgeous and down to earth women here in Bellingham. Take a word of advice.

She has never came across as the rude cold-hearted individual you seem to know her as. I found her to be a polite and honest person. So you might have to ask yourself.. is she really 'a bitch and a half?' or was she just responding to your over inflated ego and lack of respect for her and yourself. You are right though, she is attractive. But she also doesn't tolerate bullshit. I don't know who you are so I cant judge completely, but based on the fact that you were strolling through the missed connections section and decided to take it upon yourself to talk shit about someone I and many others find to be an enjoyable person to be around leads me to believe you're just a titanic douche. \n\nWith that said..
